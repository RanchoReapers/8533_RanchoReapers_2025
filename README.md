What is a Workspace?
----
After competition, a Workspace is used to test new features and start changing the code for new elements in next year's robot. For example, the 2025 robot had an arm, but the 2026 robot will have an elevator. In order to keep the old robot working and around for training/testing purposes, a new repository (Workspace) is created as a placeholder for the 2026 repository. Since WPILib forces you to create a new folder when importing a project between major versions (i.e. 2025 > 2026), a new repository is required for the update. To avoid waiting until the next major version of WPILib, between releases a Workspace is used to save code changes that will be implemented the following year.

What Needs to be Done?

(In order of importance)
- For the 2 nested steps, first learn how to simulate a controller
    - Write code for autonomous mode using a controller simulation
    - Translate aim assist code from tank to swerve
- Implement pathing to autonomous and aim assist using Choreo
